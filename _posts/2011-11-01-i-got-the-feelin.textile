<p>As a kid, I saw pictures of James Brown on stage with two drummers.  That was cool, and it let me off the hook when I couldn’t play the grooves from the records.  I figured, “If I can get close to the original using only four limbs, that’s pretty good.”</p>

<p>Turns out it was four limbs playing those grooves.  Clyde Stubblefield’s four limbs.</p>

<p>I wasn’t the only one fooled.  When “I Got the Feelin’” dropped, drummers everywhere retreated to their basements.</p>

<p>It’s Clyde’s fast left hand that makes him sound like two drummers.</p>

<p>His groups of three 16th notes on the snare are funky and righteously difficult.</p>

<p>Trying to make his grooves happen — even at slow tempos — takes time, repetition and repetition.</p>
