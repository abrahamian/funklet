<p>Fact: Zigaboo used two hands on the hat when recording “Cissy Strut.”</p>

<p>Among drummers, that factoid is becoming as ubiquitous as “White Christmas was written by a Jew!”</p>

<p>Still, when I first got the memo, everything got a little lighter.</p>

<p>It never crossed my mind Zig could be using two hands on the hat.  Plus, he was breaking one of Gabriel Roth’s (Daptone Records) rules: Never use two hands on the hat unless you are actually in Ghana and it’s still 1970.</p>

<p>After I got remotely schooled by Stanton Moore’s book, the groove felt better.</p>

<p>That said, it’s still fun to play with one hand.</p>
