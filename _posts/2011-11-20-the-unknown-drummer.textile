<p>Welcome to the Tomb of the Unknowns.</p>

<p>I was listening to a friendâ€™s remix and heard a funky drum break.  I asked if he knew where the break was from, and he said it was part of a library of loops he bought.  He sent me the 1-bar cut.</p> 

<p>I Shazamed it.  I played it for some funky friends.  No one had any leads.</p>

<p>Between poor crediting (common during the sixties and seventies) and nameless loop libraries, it has become difficult to identify who played some of the funkiest beats.</p>

<p>We shall call this beat by its file name: <em>Strt Bts DC Gogo 100.</em></p>
