<p>Grooving is a spiritual thing for James Gadson.</p>

<p>On this track, the band grooved for about ten minutes straight.  After that, Bill Withers put down his vocal part and the engineer manufactured a breakdown by soloing vocals and drums for certain sections.</p>

<p>If you listen closely, you can hear the bass bleeding into the drum mics during the breakdowns.</p>

<p>I dig this work-flow.  When the album version starts, the musicians have already been deep in the groove for a few minutes.</p>
