<p>Most funky field trips makes a stop at this landmark beat.</p>
<p>Clyde started a new type of groove by playing quarter notes on the hi-hat. It gives the groove a jerky, all-broke-up feel.</p>
<p>This innovation wasn&rsquo;t a highly concious decision; Clyde just went in the studio and started up a groove.</p>
<p>Because of the quarters on the hat, the kick and snare part sound totally fresh, even though it is similar to some past Stubblefield grooves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to ballpark the dates of funk tracks based on hi-hat parts. Invite over some friends, order some pizza and try it sometime.</p>
